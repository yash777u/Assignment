Here's a comprehensive README file that outlines how to set up and run both the frontend (React) and backend (Spring Boot) of your project.

# Project Title

## Description

A brief description of your project.

## Prerequisites

- **Frontend:**
  - Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
  - npm (v6.0.0 or later) or Yarn (v1.22.0 or later)

- **Backend:**
  - JDK (Java Development Kit) 17 or later
  - Maven (v3.6.0 or later)
  - IntelliJ IDEA (optional, for development)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

## Frontend Setup (React)

### Navigate to the Frontend Directory

```bash
cd frontend
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start the Frontend Server

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the React development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

### Navigate to the Backend Directory

Open IntelliJ IDEA and navigate to the backend directory of your project.

### Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click on `Open or Import`.
3. Select the backend directory of your project.
4. Click on `Open as Project`.

### Configure the Application

Make sure to set up the necessary configurations in `application.properties` located in `src/main/resources`.

### application.properties Example

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdbname
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# JWT properties
jwt.secret=your-secret-key
jwt.expiration=86400000

# Redis properties
spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379
```

### Install Dependencies and Build the Project

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### Run the Spring Boot Application

You can run the application directly from IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Navigate to the `Application.java` file.
2. Right-click on the file and select `Run 'Application.main()'`.

Or, use the command line:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This will start the backend server at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running the Application

1. Ensure both the frontend and backend servers are running.
2. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the frontend.

## Additional Information

- **API Documentation:** The backend API is documented using Swagger UI. You can access it at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
- **Environment Variables:** You can configure the environment variables for both frontend and backend in `.env` files if necessary.
